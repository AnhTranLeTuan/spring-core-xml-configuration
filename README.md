# Spring core: Configuration with only XML File

## Description
Experiment with concepts of inversion of control and dependency injection by the XML file. In this project, we can see how:
* Classes will be marked as beans
* Bean scopes
* Bean life cycle
* Activate component scan
* Inject constants or objects into specific variables
* Retrieve data from the properties file
