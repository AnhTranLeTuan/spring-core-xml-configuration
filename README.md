# Spring core: Configuration with only XML File

## Description
Experiment with concepts of inversion of control and dependency injection by the XML file. In this project, we can see how:
* Classes will be marked as beans
* Bean scopes (/spring-core-xml-configuration/src/main/java/configurationFileForBeanScope.xml)
* Bean life cycle (/spring-core-xml-configuration/src/main/java/configurationFileForCustomCodeBeanLifeCycle.xml)
* Activate component scan
* Inject constants or objects into specific variables (/spring-core-xml-configuration/src/main/java/configurationFileForDependencyInjection.xml)
* Retrieve data from the properties file
